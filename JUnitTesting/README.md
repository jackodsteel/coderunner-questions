# JUnit test runner prototype

The xml file contains the up to date prototype as well as a working example implementation.

The python file is the up to date template for the prototype.

There is an accompanying Python unittest class that does some validation against the template.

To run the python file junit-platform-console-standalone-1.5.2.jar is required. It can be downloaded from:

https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/junit/platform/junit-platform-console-standalone/1.5.2/junit-platform-console-standalone-1.5.2.jar
